    "text": "10.1 The Fixed-Payment Loan (Ch. 4)\nYour auto loan is a fixed-payment loan — one of the four credit market instruments Mishkin describes. The loan value equals the present value of all future payments:\n\\[\nLV = \\frac{FP}{(1+i)} + \\frac{FP}{(1+i)^2} + \\frac{FP}{(1+i)^3} + \\cdots + \\frac{FP}{(1+i)^n} \\tag{11}\n\\]\nwhere \\(LV\\) = loan value, \\(FP\\) = fixed payment, \\(i\\) = interest rate, \\(n\\) = number of periods.\nThis is exactly the annuity present value formula. When we solve for \\(FP\\) (the payment), we get Equation (3) from earlier. The lender’s perspective: they’re buying a stream of your future payments at a price equal to the loan amount."

For your auto loan:\n\nIf market rates drop after you lock in at 10%, your loan becomes expensive relative to new loans — you’re overpaying (an incentive to refinance)\nIf market rates rise, your locked-in rate looks like a bargain\n\nThis is the same inverse relationship that governs bond prices."

This is interest-rate risk applied to consumer finance — the same concept Mishkin discusses for bonds, just in your driveway."
