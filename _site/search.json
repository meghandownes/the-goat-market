The faceted analysis allows us to understand whether performance differences are consistent across sections or vary by section type. Key insights include:\n\nOverall Performance: The combined analysis provides a general comparison between human and AI performance across all data.\nSection-Specific Patterns: The faceted analysis reveals whether certain sections favor one group over another, which could indicate section-specific strengths or weaknesses.\nStatistical Significance: Both overall and section-specific statistical tests help determine whether observed differences are likely due to chance or represent genuine performance differences.\nEffect Sizes: Cohen’s d values provide insight into the practical significance of any differences, helping to understand not just whether differences exist, but how meaningful they are.\n\nThis comprehensive analysis framework allows for both broad and detailed insights into Human vs AI performance patterns across different test sections.",

All of these are real objects, and really on campus. While you are exploring campus get to know your classmate(s). Ask questions about where they are from and what they like. Are they math-y people or arts-y people? What do they think they want to be “when they grow up”? You will write a short paragraph about your class mate to add to your scavenger hunt.\n\n\nQuestion 1\nPlease find the giant monster head. Take a funny picture in front of it with a classmate or two. Then add the picture to your scavenger hunt note.\n\n\nQuestion 2\nFind the whale. Take another silly picture and add it to your note. Where did you find the whale?\n\n\nQuestion 3\nFind the airplane suspended in the air. Then browse around. Find something interesting that you might buy if you wanted to. How much does it cost? Is that ridiculous or reasonable? What is the per unit price?\n\n\nBonus Question!\nFind Sid the Sloth. Where is he? Take a picture and write up some information on Giant Sloths.\n\n\nQuestion 4\nPlease write a short paragraph about the person with whom you completed the scavenger hunt.\n\n\n\n\n Back to top",

Macroeconomics examines how entire economies function—from business cycles and unemployment to inflation, economic growth, and international trade. Students will learn to analyze aggregate economic behavior, government policy effectiveness, and the complex interactions between fiscal and monetary policy through the lens of multiple economic schools of thought, while developing advanced AI partnership capabilities for economic research and policy analysis.\nThe course emphasizes practical applications of macroeconomic theory to current policy debates, including Federal Reserve decisions, government spending and taxation, international economic relations, and long-term growth strategies. Students will engage with diverse theoretical perspectives—from Keynesian demand management to Austrian business cycle theory—to develop nuanced understanding of how national economies function and how policy can influence economic outcomes.",

Learning effective AI partnership now builds capabilities needed for professional success while maintaining high standards for macroeconomic reasoning and ethical practice.",

You need to find evidence from a variety of sources and properly document and cite your evidence. This is an area where Obsidian excels. Once you find interesting information you can take screenshots, type, text, upload images or graphs, and even create graphics using Excalidraw. The community groups for Obsidian and YouTube have lots of “how-to” guides and conversations to inspire you and help with any technical issues. AI is helpful with troubleshooting and can provide step-by-step solutions, and you may use these for this portion of the assignment if you want. Google Scholar is your friend – as a reminder.\nYour evidence should include the following sources:\n\nScholarly\nNews\nAnecdotal\nConversations with Humans\nSocial Media\n\nYou can create links to keywords using the two “[[]]” . These links will connect different ideas, and provide links to the citations. You can also add inline footnotes using “” to help document your evidence. Create a rich document for yourself on the potential benefits and the harms of AI.",
