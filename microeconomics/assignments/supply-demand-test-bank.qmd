# ANSWER KEY

## Section A: Graphing Questions

**A1.** 
- Demand intercepts: $(P = 50, Q = 0)$ and $(P = 0, Q = 100)$
- Supply intercepts: $(P = 6.67, Q = 0)$ and $(P = 0, Q = -20)$
- Equilibrium: Set $100 - 2P = -20 + 3P$, solve: $120 = 5P$, so $P^* = 24$, $Q^* = 52$

**A2.**
- Original equilibrium: $80 - 4P = -40 + 2P \Rightarrow 120 = 6P \Rightarrow P^* = 20$, $Q^* = 0$
- New demand: $Q_D' = 110 - 4P$
- New equilibrium: $110 - 4P = -40 + 2P \Rightarrow 150 = 6P \Rightarrow P' = 25$, $Q' = 10$
- Both price and quantity increase

**A3.**
- Original equilibrium: $120 - 3P = -30 + 2P \Rightarrow 150 = 5P \Rightarrow P^* = 30$, $Q^* = 30$
- After-tax supply: $Q_S = -30 + 2(P - 6) = -42 + 2P$
- New equilibrium: $120 - 3P = -42 + 2P \Rightarrow 162 = 5P \Rightarrow P_B = 32.4$, $Q = 22.8$
- Sellers receive: $P_S = 32.4 - 6 = 26.4$

**A4.**
- Equilibrium: $150 - 2P = -50 + 4P \Rightarrow 200 = 6P \Rightarrow P^* = 33.33$, $Q^* = 83.33$
- Since $P_f = 25 < P^* = 33.33$, the floor is not binding
- No surplus or shortage results

**A5.**
- Equilibrium: $180 - 4P = -60 + 6P \Rightarrow 240 = 10P \Rightarrow P^* = 24$, $Q^* = 84$
- Since $P_c = 15 < P^* = 24$, the ceiling is binding
- At $P = 15$: $Q_D = 120$, $Q_S = 30$
- Shortage = $120 - 30 = 90$

## Section B: Definition Questions

**B1.** Consumer surplus is the area between the demand curve and the market price, representing the difference between what consumers are willing to pay and what they actually pay. For a linear demand curve, CS = $\frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height} = \frac{1}{2} \times Q^* \times (P_{\text{choke}} - P^*)$

**B2.** Producer surplus is the area between the market price and the supply curve, representing the difference between what producers receive and their minimum acceptable price. For a linear supply curve, PS = $\frac{1}{2} \times Q^* \times (P^* - P_{\text{minimum}})$

**B3.** A "change in demand" refers to a shift of the entire demand curve due to factors other than price (income, preferences, etc.). A "change in quantity demanded" refers to movement along a fixed demand curve due to a price change.

**B4.** Deadweight loss is the loss of economic efficiency that occurs when the equilibrium outcome is not achieved, typically due to market interventions like taxes, price controls, or monopoly power. It represents mutually beneficial trades that do not occur.

**B5.** Price elasticity of demand measures the responsiveness of quantity demanded to price changes. For linear demand $Q_D = a - bP$: 
$$\varepsilon = \frac{\partial Q}{\partial P} \times \frac{P}{Q} = -b \times \frac{P}{Q}$$

## Section C: Synthesis Questions

**C1.** Setting $Q_D = Q_S$: $a - bP = c + dP$
Solving: $P^* = \frac{a - c}{b + d}$ and $Q^* = \frac{ad + bc}{b + d}$

**C2.** With tax $t$ on sellers, after-tax supply becomes $Q_S = c + d(P - t)$
New equilibrium: $P_B^* = \frac{a - c + dt}{b + d}$ and $P_S^* = P_B^* - t = \frac{a - c - bt}{b + d}$

**C3.** Whether the tax is imposed on buyers or sellers, it creates the same vertical wedge of size $t$ between the price paid and price received. The final equilibrium depends only on the size of this wedge, not which side initially bears the tax. The economic incidence is determined by the relative elasticities of supply and demand.

**C4.** Shortage = $Q_D(P_c) - Q_S(P_c)$ where $P_c$ is the ceiling price. Efficiency problem: Prevents mutually beneficial trades from occurring, creates deadweight loss, and may lead to non-price rationing mechanisms that don't allocate goods to those who value them most.

**C5.** Consumer surplus at equilibrium:
$$CS = \frac{1}{2} \times Q^* \times (P_{\text{choke}} - P^*) = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{ad + bc}{b + d} \times \frac{c}{b + d} = \frac{c(ad + bc)}{2(b + d)^2}$$

## Section D: Numerical Problems

**D1.** 
a) $90 - 3P = -30 + 2P \Rightarrow 120 = 5P \Rightarrow P^* = 24$, $Q^* = 18$
b) CS = $\frac{1}{2} \times 18 \times (30 - 24) = 54$; PS = $\frac{1}{2} \times 18 \times (24 - 15) = 81$

**D2.**
a) After-tax supply: $Q_S = -20 + 3(P - 10) = -50 + 3P$
   New equilibrium: $60 - 2P = -50 + 3P \Rightarrow 110 = 5P \Rightarrow P_B = 22$, $Q = 16$
   $P_S = 22 - 10 = 12$
b) Tax revenue = $10 \times 16 = 160$; Original $Q^* = 20$, DWL = $\frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times 4 = 20$

**D3.**
a) $140 - 3P = -40 + 2P \Rightarrow 180 = 5P \Rightarrow P^* = 36$
   Since $P_f = 20 < P^* = 36$, floor is not binding
b) No surplus results

**D4.**
a) $100 - 2P = -20 + 4P \Rightarrow 120 = 6P \Rightarrow P^* = 20$
   Since $P_c = 12 < P^* = 20$, ceiling is binding
b) At $P = 12$: $Q_D = 76$, $Q_S = 28$, Shortage = $76 - 28 = 48$

**D5.**
a) At $P = 10$: $Q = 80 - 4(10) = 40$
   $\varepsilon = -4 \times \frac{10}{40} = -1$
b) $|\varepsilon| = 1$, so demand is unit elastic
