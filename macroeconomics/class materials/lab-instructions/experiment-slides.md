# Division of Labor Experiment
## Using Origami Seals to Understand Economic Principles

---

# Overview
## What We're Learning Today

- **Division of Labor** - How breaking tasks into parts increases efficiency
- **Specialization** - Focusing on what you do best
- **Comparative Advantage** - Producing at lower opportunity cost
- **Adam Smith's Insights** - The foundation of modern economics

---

# The Experiment Setup
## Two Rounds of Production

**Goal**: Make as many origami seals as possible
**Materials**: Paper squares, instruction sheets
**Time**: 15 minutes per round

---

# Round 1: Individual Production
## The Self-Sufficient Approach

### Timeline:
- **Minutes 1-7**: Work alone, instructions only
- **Minutes 8-9**: Internet access allowed
- **Minutes 10-15**: Collaboration permitted

### Rules:
- Raise your hand when you complete a seal
- Wait quietly until round ends
- No talking during solo phase

---

# Round 1: What to Expect
## Individual Challenges

- Learning curve for new skill
- No specialization benefits
- Limited knowledge sharing
- Each person does every step

### Success = Becoming a "Manager"
**If you complete a seal, you'll lead a team in Round 2!**

---

# Intermission: Manager Briefing
## For Successful Round 1 Participants

While successful students meet in hallway:
- **Your new role**: Team manager
- **Your challenge**: Organize 5-10 classmates for maximum production
- **Your goal**: Lead your team to victory
- **Prize**: 5 bonus points for winning team

---

# Round 2: Team Production
## The Division of Labor Approach

### Setup:
- Managers organize their teams
- Teams compete for highest production
- Same 15-minute time limit
- Same materials and instructions

### Strategy Session:
- 3-5 minutes for team planning
- Managers step out to allow brainstorming

---

# Round 2: Division of Labor
## How Will You Organize?

### Possible Strategies:
- **Assembly Line**: Each person does one step
- **Specialization**: Best folders focus on complex steps
- **Quality Control**: Dedicated inspectors
- **Supply Chain**: Paper distribution specialists

---

# The Economics Behind It
## Why This Matters

### Adam Smith's Pin Factory (1776):
- 1 person making whole pins = 20 pins/day
- 10 people with divided labor = 48,000 pins/day
- **2,400x productivity increase!**

### Your Origami Factory:
- How much did productivity increase?
- Which strategies worked best?
- Who had comparative advantages?

---

# Data Collection
## What We'll Measure

- **Round 1**: Individual completion rates
- **Round 2**: Team production totals
- **Productivity per person** in each round
- **Time to completion** for individual seals
- **Success strategies** used by teams

---

# Discussion Questions
## After the Experiment

- How did collaboration change productivity?
- What specialized roles emerged naturally?
- Who had comparative advantages in different tasks?
- How did division of labor affect quality?
- What real-world examples can you think of?

---

# Learning Objectives
## Economic Principles in Action

By the end of this experiment, you will understand:

1. **Division of Labor** increases total output
2. **Specialization** makes individuals more efficient
3. **Comparative Advantage** benefits everyone
4. **Coordination** creates additional value
5. **Adam Smith's insights** still apply today

# Ready to Begin?
## Let's Start Round 1!

### Remember:
- Follow instructions carefully
- Work silently until told otherwise
- Raise your hand when you complete a seal
- Think about what you're learning!

**Good luck, economists!**
