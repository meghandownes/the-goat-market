## Pre-Experiment Preparation

### Setup (10 minutes before class):
1. **Arrange seating** in groups of 8-12 students (future team size)
2. **Distribute materials** to each student
3. **Prepare data tracking sheet** on whiteboard
4. **Review timing** with any teaching assistants

### Introduction (5 minutes):
1. **Explain objectives**: "Today we'll discover why teamwork can be more productive"
2. **Preview experiment**: Two 15-minute rounds with different rules
3. **Emphasize data collection**: Accurate measurement is crucial for analysis

## Round 1: Individual Production (15 minutes)

### Instructions to Students:
*"You have 15 minutes to fold as many origami seals as possible. For the first 7 minutes, work completely alone using only the instruction sheet. After 7 minutes, I'll announce that you can use the internet. After 2 more minutes, you can help each other. When you complete a seal, raise your hand and I'll verify it. Keep working until time is up."*

### Instructor Tasks:

**Minutes 1-7: Solo Phase**
- Start timer and announce "Begin working alone"
- Circulate quietly, observing different approaches
- **Do not help or answer questions**
- Note who completes seals quickly (future managers)

**Minute 7: Internet Phase**
- Announce: "You may now use internet resources"
- Continue observing and verifying completed seals

**Minute 9: Collaboration Phase**
- Announce: "You may now help each other"
- Watch for natural teaching/helping behaviors

**Minute 15: End of Round 1**
- "Stop working, hands up"
- **Immediately identify managers**: "Students who completed at least one seal, please come with me to the hallway"

### Data Collection:
- **Track individual completions** on whiteboard
- **Record completion times** when hands are raised
- **Count total class production**

## Manager Briefing (5 minutes in hallway)

### Instructions for Managers:
*"Congratulations! You've proven you can complete this task. In Round 2, your job changes completely. You're now team managers responsible for organizing your classmates to maximize production. You'll each get 5-10 teammates. The team that produces the most seals in 15 minutes wins 5 bonus points each."*

### Key Points:
- **Your role**: Organize and coordinate, don't do all the work yourself
- **Your challenge**: How will you divide up the tasks?
- **Your advantage**: You know how to complete the task
- **Strategy time**: You'll have 3-5 minutes to plan with your team

---

## Round 2: Team Production (20 minutes total)

### Team Assignment (2 minutes):
- **Divide remaining students** among managers
- **Aim for 5-10 students per team** (adjust based on manager count)
- **Keep teams roughly equal in size**

### Strategy Planning (5 minutes):
*"Managers, organize your teams however you think will be most productive. You have 5 minutes to plan your approach."*

- **Managers stay with teams** during planning
- **Instructor observes** different strategies emerging
- **Note creative approaches** for later discussion

### Production Round (15 minutes):
*"Same rules as before: 15 minutes to produce as many seals as possible. This time you're working as teams. Managers, you're in charge!"*

### Instructor Tasks:
- **Start timer** and monitor all teams
- **Track team production** separately
- **Observe division of labor strategies**:
  - Assembly line approaches?
  - Quality control specialists?
  - Paper distribution systems?
  - Training/teaching roles?

### Data Collection:
- **Record each team's final count**
- **Note strategies used** by successful teams
- **Time individual seal completions** if possible

## Immediate Debrief (10 minutes)

### Data Analysis on Whiteboard:
1. **Round 1 Results**:
   - Individual completion rate: ___% 
   - Total class production: ___
   - Average per person: ___

2. **Round 2 Results**:

---

## Assessment and Follow-up

### Homework Assignment:
- **Worksheet completion** (due next class)
- **Grade using provided rubric** (100 points total)
- **Look for economic concept understanding**

### Next Class Discussion:
1. **Review worksheet results** collectively
2. **Connect to larger economic concepts**:
   - Why are some countries wealthier?
   - How does trade increase global productivity?
   - What role does specialization play in careers?

## Common Challenges and Solutions

### Problem: Students struggle with origami instructions
**Solution**: This is part of the learning! The difficulty demonstrates why collaboration helps.

### Problem: Some students finish Round 1 very quickly
**Solution**: Great! These become your managers. Have them observe others.

### Problem: Teams develop very different strategies
**Solution**: Perfect! This creates rich discussion about different approaches.

### Problem: One team dominates Round 2
**Solution**: Focus on the strategies they used, not just the winning.

## Extensions and Variations

### For Advanced Classes:
- **Add cost analysis**: Assign "wages" and calculate profit per seal
- **Include quality control**: Deduct points for sloppy folds
- **Multiple rounds**: Try 3+ rounds with different team compositions

### For Larger Classes:
- **Multiple simultaneous experiments**: Split into 2-3 groups
- **Tournament format**: Winning teams compete against each other
- **Cross-class competitions**: Compare results between periods

### For Time Constraints:
- **Reduce to 10-minute rounds** if needed
- **Simplify origami** to basic shapes
- **Focus on one key concept** rather than all three

## Answer Key for Student Worksheet

### Expected Productivity Improvements:
Typical results show **200-400% productivity increases** from Round 1 to Round 2, similar to Adam Smith's pin factory observations.

### Key Economic Concepts Students Should Identify:

**Division of Labor Benefits**:
1. Increased dexterity through repetition
2. Time savings from not switching tasks  
3. Innovation in tools and methods

**Specialization Examples**:
- Fast folders focus on complex steps
- Detail-oriented students handle quality control
- Natural teachers help struggling teammates

**Comparative Advantage**:
- Students who learn quickly teach others
- Those with fine motor skills handle detailed folds
- Organized students manage workflow

## Theoretical Background

### Adam Smith's Pin Factory (1776):
- **Individual worker**: 20 pins per day
- **10 workers with division of labor**: 48,000 pins per day
- **2,400x increase in productivity**

### Modern Research Connections:
- **Learning curves**: Productivity improves with repetition
- **Team coordination**: Organization creates additional value
- **Comparative advantage**: Everyone benefits from specialization

This experiment typically produces results that mirror Smith's original observations, making it a powerful demonstration of timeless economic principles.

*Good luck with your experiment! Remember: the messiness and confusion in Round 1 is not a bugâ€”it's a feature that makes the Round 2 improvements even more dramatic.*
