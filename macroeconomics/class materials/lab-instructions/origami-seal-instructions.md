## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Initial Diagonal Fold
**Fold the paper in half diagonally and then unfold it.**
- This creates your center crease line
- Make sure the fold is sharp and clean

### Step 2: Fold Corners to Center
**Fold both the top and bottom corners to meet at the center crease.**
- Align the edges carefully
- Press down firmly to create clear fold lines

### Step 3: Fold Sides to Center
**Fold the left and right sides to the center crease line.**
- Make sure edges align with the center crease
- Your paper should now look like a narrower diamond shape

### Step 4: Create Rabbit Ear Folds
**Open up the folded sections and create rabbit ear folds on both sides.**
- Pull out the trapped paper from inside
- Flatten into neat triangular flaps
- This creates what's called a "Fish Base"

### Step 5: Fold in Half
**Fold the paper in half lengthwise, bringing bottom section behind the top.**
- Fold backward (mountain fold)
- Make sure edges align

### Step 6: Create the Neck
**Make an inside reverse fold along the dotted line to form the seal's neck.**
- Push the paper inside to create the neck curve
- Make sure the fold is clean and symmetrical

### Step 7: Form the Head
**Make another inside reverse fold to create the seal's head.**
- The head should point upward at an angle
- Adjust the angle as needed for a natural look

### Step 8: Shape the Nose
**Make a small inside reverse fold at the tip to flatten the nose area.**
- This creates a more realistic seal face
- Keep this fold small and neat

### Step 9: Form the Flippers
**Fold out the rabbit ear flaps to create the front flippers.**
- Fold along the dotted lines on both sides
- These will be the seal's front flippers

### Step 10: Create the Tail
**Make an inside reverse fold at the back to form the tail.**
- The tail should point downward
- Make sure it's proportional to the body

## Final Touches
- Gently adjust all folds to ensure your seal sits properly
- You can draw on eyes or other details if desired
- Congratulations! You've completed your origami seal!

## Tips for Success
- **Precision matters**: Clean, sharp folds make all the difference
- **Take your time**: Rushing leads to sloppy results
- **Practice makes perfect**: Don't worry if your first attempt isn't perfect
- **Help when allowed**: Collaboration can improve everyone's results

## Troubleshooting
- **Paper won't stay folded**: Make sure you're pressing firmly on each crease
- **Steps don't match**: Double-check that you followed each step exactly
- **Seal won't stand**: Adjust the tail and flipper positions for better balance
