## Round 1: Individual Production

### Instructions to Give Students:
> [!quote] Exact Script
> "You have 15 minutes to fold as many origami seals as possible. For the first 7 minutes, work completely alone using only the instruction sheet. After 7 minutes, I'll announce that you can use the internet. After 2 more minutes, you can help each other. When you complete a seal, raise your hand and I'll verify it. Keep working until time is up."

### Instructor Tasks:

**Minutes 1-7: Solo Phase**
- [ ] Start timer, announce "Begin working alone"
- [ ] Circulate quietly, observe approaches
- [ ] **No helping or answering questions**
- [ ] Note quick completers (future managers)

**Minute 7: Internet Phase**  
- [ ] Announce: "You may now use internet resources"
- [ ] Continue observing, verify completed seals

**Minute 9: Collaboration Phase**
- [ ] Announce: "You may now help each other"
- [ ] Watch for natural teaching/helping behaviors

**Minute 15: Round End**
- [ ] "Stop working, hands up"
- [ ] **Immediately identify managers**: "Students who completed at least one seal, come with me"

### Data to Track:
- [ ] Individual completion count
- [ ] Completion times (when hands raised)
- [ ] Total class production

---

## Manager Briefing (Hallway)

### Instructions for New Managers:
> [!important] Manager Speech
> "Congratulations! You've proven you can complete this task. In Round 2, your job changes completely. You're now team managers responsible for organizing your classmates to maximize production. You'll each get 5-10 teammates. The team that produces the most seals in 15 minutes wins 5 bonus points each."

### Key Points to Emphasize:
- **Role change**: Organize and coordinate, don't do all the work
- **Challenge**: How to divide up tasks effectively
- **Advantage**: You understand the complete process
- **Strategy time**: 3-5 minutes to plan with team

---

## Round 2: Team Production

### Team Formation (2 minutes):
- [ ] Divide remaining students among managers
- [ ] Aim for 5-10 students per team
- [ ] Keep teams roughly equal in size

### Strategy Planning (5 minutes):
> [!quote] Instructions
> "Managers, organize your teams however you think will be most productive. You have 5 minutes to plan your approach."

**Observe for:**
- [ ] Assembly line approaches
- [ ] Quality control specialists  
- [ ] Paper distribution systems
- [ ] Training/teaching roles

### Production Phase (15 minutes):
> [!quote] Round 2 Launch
> "Same rules as before: 15 minutes to produce as many seals as possible. This time you're working as teams. Managers, you're in charge!"

**Track:**
- [ ] Each team's production separately
- [ ] Strategies used by successful teams
- [ ] Individual seal completion times (if possible)

## Common Challenges & Solutions

> [!warning] Challenge: Students struggle with origami
> **Solution:** This is intentional! Difficulty demonstrates value of collaboration.

> [!warning] Challenge: Some students finish Round 1 very quickly
> **Solution:** Perfect! These become managers and can observe others.

> [!warning] Challenge: Teams develop very different strategies  
> **Solution:** Excellent! Creates rich discussion about approaches.

> [!warning] Challenge: One team dominates Round 2
> **Solution:** Focus on strategies used, not just winning.

---

## Extension Activities

### For Advanced Classes:
- [ ] **Cost analysis**: Assign wages, calculate profit per seal
- [ ] **Quality control**: Deduct points for poor folds
- [ ] **Multiple rounds**: Try 3+ rounds with different teams

### For Large Classes:
- [ ] **Multiple experiments**: Split into 2-3 groups simultaneously
- [ ] **Tournament format**: Winning teams compete
- [ ] **Cross-class competition**: Compare results between periods

### For Time Constraints:
- [ ] **Reduce to 10-minute rounds**
- [ ] **Simplify origami** to basic shapes
- [ ] **Focus on one concept** instead of all three

## Theoretical Connections

### Adam Smith's Pin Factory (1776):
```
Individual: 20 pins/day
10 workers with division of labor: 48,000 pins/day
Increase: 2,400x productivity
```

### Modern Research Links:
- [ ] Learning curves improve with repetition
- [ ] Team coordination creates additional value
- [ ] Everyone benefits from specialization

> [!note] Key Insight
> This experiment typically produces results that mirror Smith's original observations, making it a powerful demonstration of timeless economic principles.

---

## Follow-up Activities

### Next Class:
- [ ] Review worksheet results collectively
- [ ] Connect to larger economic concepts:
  - Why some countries are wealthier
  - How trade increases global productivity  
  - Role of specialization in career choice

### Long-term Connections:
- [ ] **Supply and Demand (Chapter 3)**: Markets created by specialization
- [ ] **International Trade**: Comparative advantage between countries
- [ ] **Economic Growth**: Role of institutions and specialization

---
