# The Moral Philosophical Roots of Economics
## An Introduction to Economic Thought from 1776

<!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in" style="color: white; margin-top: 50px;" -->
*From moral philosophy to modern behavioral economics*

note:
Welcome to our exploration of how economics emerged from moral philosophy. Today we'll trace the intellectual journey from 1776 to the present, showing how ethical concerns shaped economic thinking and continue to influence modern policy.

</div>
<div style="flex: 2; padding-left: 40px;">

<!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in" -->
> "How selfish soever man may be supposed, there are evidently some principles in his nature, which interest him in the fortune of others, and render their happiness necessary to him, though he derives nothing from it except the pleasure of seeing it."

<!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in" -->
**Key Works:**
- *The Theory of Moral Sentiments* (1759)
- *An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations* (1776)

</div>
</div>

note:
Smith wrote his moral philosophy BEFORE his economics. This quote from Theory of Moral Sentiments shows he understood humans as moral beings first. The invisible hand concept emerges from his broader moral framework.

## The Theory of Moral Sentiments (1759)

<!-- .element: class="fragment highlight-current-blue" -->
**Smith's Moral Foundation:**

<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- **Sympathy** as the basis of moral judgment

<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- **Impartial spectator** - moral conscience

<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Human nature includes benevolence, not just self-interest

## The Theory of Moral Sentiments (1759)

**Smith's Moral Foundation:**
- **Sympathy** as the basis of moral judgment
- **Impartial spectator** - moral conscience  
- Human nature includes benevolence, not just self-interest

<!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in" -->
> "Every man, as long as he does not violate the laws of justice, is left perfectly free to pursue his own interest in his own way."

<!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in" style="font-style: italic; color: #048A81;" -->
*Economics embedded within moral framework*

note:
The impartial spectator is Smith's version of conscience - we judge our actions by imagining how an impartial observer would view them. This is the moral foundation that underlies his later economic analysis.

## Francis Hutcheson (1694-1746)
### The Moral Sense Theorist

<div class="two-column" style="color: white;">

<div class="left">

<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
**Hutcheson's Contributions:**
- Professor of Moral Philosophy at Glasgow
- **"Moral sense"** - innate ability to distinguish right from wrong  
- **"The greatest happiness for the greatest number"**

</div>

<div class="right">

<!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in" -->
> "The Author of nature has much better furnished us for a virtuous conduct than our moralists seem to imagine, by almost as quick and powerful instructions as we have for the preservation of our bodies."

<!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in" style="font-style: italic; margin-top: 30px;" -->
*Smith's mentor and predecessor*

</div>

</div>

note:
Hutcheson actually coined the phrase "greatest happiness for the greatest number" before Bentham. He was Smith's teacher at Glasgow. His moral sense theory influenced Smith's approach to sympathy and moral judgment.

---

## David Hume (1711-1776)
### The Empiricist Friend

<div style="display: flex; align-items: center;">

<div style="flex: 1; padding-right: 40px;">

![Scottish Enlightenment Edinburgh](image:46)
<!-- .element: style="border-radius: 10px; box-shadow: 0 6px 12px rgba(0,0,0,0.3);" -->

</div>

<div style="flex: 2;">

<!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in" -->
**Hume's Influence:**

<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- **"Is-ought problem"** - cannot derive moral prescriptions from facts alone

<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- **Sentiment vs. Reason** in moral judgment

<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Price-specie-flow mechanism in economics

<!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in" -->
> "Reason is, and ought only to be the slave of the passions, and can never pretend to any other office than to serve and obey them."

</div>

</div>

note:
Hume's is-ought problem remains central to economic methodology debates today. His emphasis on sentiment over pure reason deeply influenced Smith's moral theory and approach to human behavior.

## Jeremy Bentham (1748-1832)
### The Utilitarian Revolutionary

<div class="two-column" style="color: white;">

<div class="left">

![Jeremy Bentham Portrait](image:45)
<!-- .element: style="width: 250px; border-radius: 15px; box-shadow: 0 8px 16px rgba(0,0,0,0.4);" -->

</div>

<div class="right">

<!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in" -->
**Bentham's Revolutionary Ideas (1789):**

<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- **Principle of Utility** - actions judged by consequences

<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- **Hedonistic Calculus** - mathematical approach to pleasure and pain

<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- **"Greatest happiness of the greatest number"**

</div>

</div>

note:
Bentham tried to make ethics scientific through his hedonistic calculus. He even designed a prison (the Panopticon) based on utilitarian principles. This mathematical approach to morality directly influenced economic cost-benefit analysis.

---

<!-- .slide: data-background-color="#1a1a2e" -->
## Bentham's Utilitarian Foundation

<div style="color: white;">

<!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in" -->
> "Nature has placed mankind under the governance of two sovereign masters, pain and pleasure."

<!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in" -->
> "The principle of utility recognizes this subjection, and assumes it for the foundation of that system, the object of which is to rear the fabric of felicity by the hands of reason and of law."

<!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in" -->
> "That principle which approves or disapproves of every action whatsoever, according to the tendency which it appears to have to augment or diminish the happiness of the party whose interest is in question."

<!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in" style="font-style: italic; margin-top: 40px;" -->
**The question:** *"Can they suffer?"* - Bentham on animal rights

</div>

note:
These are Bentham's exact words from his Principles of Morals and Legislation. His question about animal suffering was revolutionary for its time and shows how utilitarian thinking extends beyond human concerns.

## John Stuart Mill (1806-1873)
### Refined Utilitarianism

<div class="two-column">

<div class="left">

<!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in" -->
**Mill's Contributions:**
- **Qualitative hedonism** - higher and lower pleasures
- **Harm principle** - individual liberty
- **Diminishing marginal utility**

</div>

<div class="right">

<!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in" -->
> "It is better to be a human being dissatisfied than a pig satisfied; better to be Socrates dissatisfied than a fool satisfied."

<!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in" -->
> "The richer a man is the less he is benefited by any further addition to his income."

</div>

</div>

note:
Mill's refinement of utilitarianism addressed criticism that it was too crude. His insight about diminishing marginal utility became fundamental to modern economics. His harm principle influences economic thinking about regulation.

## Moral Sense Theory
### The Foundation of Human Economics

![Philosophy Tree](image:47)
<!-- .element: style="width: 400px; margin: 20px auto; display: block;" -->

<!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in" -->
**Core Principles:**

1. <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> **Innate Moral Faculty** - Hutcheson's "moral sense"
2. <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> **Sympathy & Sentiment** - Hume and Smith's approach  
3. <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> **Benevolence** as natural human inclination

<!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in" -->
> "His principal design is to show that human nature was not left quite indifferent in the affair of virtue." - Hutcheson

note:
This tree diagram shows philosophy's branches - note how ethics and political philosophy form the foundation for economic thought. Moral sense theory rejected both pure selfishness and pure rationalism.

## The Greatest Happiness Principle

<div style="color: white; display: flex; align-items: center;">

<div style="flex: 1;">

![Utilitarian Balance](image:52)
<!-- .element: style="border-radius: 10px; box-shadow: 0 6px 12px rgba(0,0,0,0.3);" -->

</div>

<div style="flex: 2; padding-left: 40px;">

<!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in" -->
**Bentham's Formula:**

<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- **Pleasure = Good**
- **Pain = Evil**
- **Maximize total happiness**
- **Minimize total suffering**

<!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in" -->
> "It is the greatest happiness of the greatest number that is the measure of right and wrong."

<!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in" -->
**Hedonic Calculus:** Intensity, Duration, Certainty, Propinquity, Fecundity, Purity, Extent

</div>

</div>

note:
The balance scale represents the utilitarian weighing of pleasure against pain. Bentham's seven factors for measuring pleasure and pain attempted to make moral decisions mathematical - a direct precursor to economic cost-benefit analysis.

## From Moral Philosophy to Economics

<!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in" -->
**The Evolution:**

1. **Moral Philosophy** (pre-1776) - normative, ethical focus
2. **Political Economy** (1776-1870) - descriptive with moral foundation
3. **Economics** (1870+) - mathematical, supposedly value-free

## From Moral Philosophy to Economics

<div style="color: white;">

**The Evolution:**
1. **Moral Philosophy** (pre-1776) - normative, ethical focus
2. **Political Economy** (1776-1870) - descriptive with moral foundation  
3. **Economics** (1870+) - mathematical, supposedly value-free

<!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in" -->
> "Economics grew out of moral philosophy and eventually became one of the moral sciences. At some point the mainstream of economics became detached from the moral sciences." - James E. Alvey

<!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in" style="font-style: italic;" -->
*What was gained? What was lost?*

</div>

note:
The marginalist revolution of the 1870s (Jevons, Menger, Walras) began the mathematization of economics. This brought precision but arguably lost sight of moral foundations. Modern behavioral economics represents a return to psychological realism.

## Modern Applications: Welfare Economics

<div style="color: white;">

<!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in" -->
**Utilitarian Roots in Policy:**

<div class="two-column">

<div class="left">

<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- **Cost-benefit analysis**
- **Pareto efficiency**
- **Social welfare functions**  
- **Public goods provision**

</div>

<div class="right">

<!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in" -->
> "The impact of utilitarianism is seen especially when economists engage in modern day cost-benefit analyses based upon welfare economics."

</div>

</div>

<!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in" style="margin-top: 40px;" -->
**The Problem:** Interpersonal utility comparisons and distribution

</div>

note:
Every time we do cost-benefit analysis or talk about social welfare, we're using utilitarian logic. But how do we compare one person's utility to another's? How do we handle inequality? These are the unresolved moral questions in modern economics.

## Modern Applications: Behavioral Economics

<!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in" -->
**Back to Moral Psychology:**

<div class="two-column">

<div class="left">

<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- **Bounded rationality** (Herbert Simon)
- **Prospect theory** (Kahneman & Tversky)
- **Nudge theory** - libertarian paternalism

</div>

<div class="right">

<!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in" -->
> "According to Thaler, some important ideas in the field can be traced back to 18th-century Scottish economist Adam Smith."

<!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in" -->
**Smith recognized:** Overconfidence, loss aversion, self-control problems

</div>

</div>

note:
Behavioral economics brings psychology back into economics - very similar to Smith's moral psychology approach. Thaler explicitly acknowledges Smith's insights about human psychological biases that weren't captured in rational choice models.

## Contemporary Challenges

<div style="color: white;">

<!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in" -->
**The Moral-Economics Divide:**

<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
1. **Values vs. Facts** - Hume's is-ought problem persists

<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
2. **Efficiency vs. Equity** - technical vs. moral questions

<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
3. **Individual vs. Social** - methodological individualism

<!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in" -->
**Critical Questions:**
- Can economics be value-free?
- What role should moral considerations play?
- How do we balance efficiency and justice?

</div>

note:
These tensions remain unresolved in modern economics. Climate change, inequality, healthcare - all require both technical economic analysis AND moral judgment. The philosophical foundations we've studied remain relevant.

## Conclusion: The Enduring Legacy

<div style="color: white;">

<!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in" -->
**Key Insights:**

<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
1. **Economics born from moral philosophy** - not separate disciplines

<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
2. **Human nature is complex** - not just rational self-interest

<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
3. **Values matter** - cannot separate facts from ethics entirely

<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
4. **Utility has limits** - distribution and rights matter

<!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in" -->
> "The nature of modern economics has been substantially impoverished by the distance that has grown between economics and ethics." - Amartya Sen

<!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in" style="font-style: italic;" -->
**The Challenge:** Rebuilding economics on moral foundations for the 21st century

</div>

note:
Sen won the Nobel Prize partly for bringing ethical considerations back into economic development theory. The question for future economists: How do we maintain analytical rigor while acknowledging moral foundations?

## Discussion Questions

<div style="display: grid; grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr; gap: 40px; margin-top: 40px;">

<div>

<!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in" -->
1. How do Smith's moral sentiments relate to modern behavioral economics?

<!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in" -->
2. Can Bentham's utilitarian calculus adequately address issues of justice and rights?

<!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in" -->
3. What role should moral philosophy play in contemporary economic policy?

</div>

<div>

<!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in" -->
4. How might we reconcile efficiency with equity in economic analysis?

<!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in" -->  
5. Is a purely "scientific" economics possible or desirable?

</div>

</div>

<!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in" style="margin-top: 60px; font-style: italic; color: #048A81;" -->
*What do you think? Has economics lost its moral compass, or gained analytical precision?*

note:
These questions connect our historical survey to contemporary debates. Encourage students to think about their own values and how they relate to economic analysis. The goal is critical thinking, not predetermined answers.

note:
End with Sen's quote to emphasize that economics cannot escape moral reasoning - it's built into the discipline's foundations. Thank the audience and open for questions.
