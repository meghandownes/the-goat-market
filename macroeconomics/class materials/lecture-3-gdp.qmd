# Measuring the Economy

How do we measure how well a country is doing? If you are an economist, you do this by measuring the output of an economy. We use the measure, "Gross Domestic Product". Sounds totally gross dude :) but what it really means is the take all the finished goods and services produced within a country within a year and adding it up. We call this GDP or Gross Domestic Product. It is one way of measuring how well and economy is doing.
