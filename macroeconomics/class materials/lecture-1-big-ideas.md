# Unlimited Wants and Needs

Life and humans have an [[*insatiable*]] desire for more.  There are no bounds to what people want or need.  

![Unlimited Wants and Needs](Unlimited%20Wants%20and%20Needs.md)

Our desire for more of everything, and never being truly satisfied is a core assumption in economics.  This will form a cornerstone of [Utility Theory](Utility%20Theory)  which underlies [[Demand]]

# Scarcity

Everything is scarce:
- Time
- Money
- Energy
- food
- Water
- Land
- Life...

# Opportunity Cost

- Life is about trade-offs
- Because resources are scarce, but wants and needs are unlimited we cannot have everything we want.
- This means we have to make trade-offs.
- We have to choose between the different possibilities.
- Opportunity Cost is the value of the next best alternative.

[[Opportunity Cost]]

*the value of the next best alternative*

1 hour of EmoChicken = 1 Tasty Lemon Cake

*If it takes me 1-hour to make an EmoChicken GIF, and 1-hour to make a tasty lemon cake, then the cost of making EmoChicken is the lemon cake -- the next best use of my time and energy!  The cost of the lemon cake is therefore the EmoChicken GIF*
