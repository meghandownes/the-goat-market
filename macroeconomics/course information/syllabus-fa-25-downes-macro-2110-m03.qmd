### Course Description

This course provides a comprehensive introduction to macroeconomic theory and its applications to real-world policy challenges and economic systems. Macroeconomics examines how entire economies function—from business cycles and unemployment to inflation, economic growth, and international trade. Students will learn to analyze aggregate economic behavior, government policy effectiveness, and the complex interactions between fiscal and monetary policy through the lens of multiple economic schools of thought, while developing advanced AI partnership capabilities for economic research and policy analysis.

The course emphasizes practical applications of macroeconomic theory to current policy debates, including Federal Reserve decisions, government spending and taxation, international economic relations, and long-term growth strategies. Students will engage with diverse theoretical perspectives—from Keynesian demand management to Austrian business cycle theory—to develop nuanced understanding of how national economies function and how policy can influence economic outcomes.
