    -   Name it something meaningful like "University Notes" or "Academic Vault"
    -   Choose location carefully - consider using cloud storage for sync
2.  **Recommended Vault Location**
    -   **Windows**: `C:\Users\[Username]\Documents\Obsidian Vaults\`
    -   **macOS**: `~/Documents/Obsidian Vaults/`
    -   **Linux**: `~/Documents/Obsidian Vaults/`
    -   **Cloud Sync**: Place in Dropbox, iCloud, OneDrive, or Google Drive folder
3.  **Initial Setup**
    -   Click "Create" to generate your vault
    -   Obsidian will open with a welcome note
