	- [ ] Use Cases for AI
- [ ] Create the following second-level headings under EACH top-level heading:
	- [ ] Background
	- [ ] Evidence
	- [ ] Conclusion
- [ ] Create the following third-level headings under each of the Evidence headings
	- [ ] Environmental
	- [ ] Economic

	- [ ] Choose your Team and write a short statement about why
- [ ] Upload Part 1 into the Canvas dropbox by September 7th, 2025 @ 11:59 pm. 
	- [ ] Please upload just the raw .md file.
	- [ ] Do not worry about broken links or ugly formatting.  

###  Instructions

Now that you have created the structure for your note, please fill in the details.  You need to find evidence from a variety of sources and properly document and cite your evidence.  This is an area where Obsidian excels.  Once you find interesting information you can take screenshots, type, text, upload images or graphs, and even create graphics using Excalidraw.  The community groups for Obsidian and YouTube have lots of "how-to" guides and conversations to inspire you and help with any technical issues.  AI is helpful with troubleshooting and can provide step-by-step solutions, and you may use these for this portion of the assignment if you want.
Google Scholar is your friend -- as a reminder. 

Your evidence should include the following sources:

- [ ] Scholarly
- [ ] News
- [ ] Anecdotal
- [ ] Conversations with Humans
- [ ] Social Media 

You can create links to keywords using the two "[[]]" .  These links will connect different ideas, and provide links to the citations.  You can also add inline footnotes using "^[]" to help document your evidence.  Create a rich document for yourself on the potential benefits and the harms of AI.
